This Arduino library allows easy interpretation of the Data/Clock pin values of a KY040 rotary encoder
and translates them into practically usable CW and CCW turns.

CCW turns are represented by an int value of -1, CW turns by 1, no movement by 0.

One needs to hook up the data output of the KY040 to 2 CHANGE interrupt inputs on the Arduino,
so the values can be processed with a high a guarantee that all state changes in the CLK / DT  values
are indeed captured.

This might under ideal circumstances also work with regular inputs (no interrupts), but the slightest
delay in the Arduino code main loop will likely cause some data changes to be missed. Missing any
values changes will turn into erretic behavior (misinterpretation of the turn direction, perceived
as jitter back and forth).
